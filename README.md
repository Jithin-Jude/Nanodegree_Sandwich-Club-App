# Sandwich Club Project

## Project Overview
In this project, you will complete the Sandwich Club app to show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project
Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for this project will help you to better understand how it is processed.

## What Will I Learn?
Through this project, you will:

Learn how to submit projects for review
Practice JSON parsing to a model object
Design an activity layout
Populate all fields in the layout accordingly

## UI/UX
